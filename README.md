# Consigliere

## Description
---
Consigliere is a cross-platform application that combines a powerful daily planner with the power of navigation and route-planning. You can use Consigliere much like your regular to-do-list. You can create, delete and edit tasks. The tasks can be attached additional information such as date, time and repetition intervals etc. The meat of Consigliere is that, you can attach location information to each task right from the built-in map. You can get an overview of where each one of your tasks is located, and you can directly search for a place if you want to add an additional task to that location.

Once you are done planning out your tasks, Consigliere will offer you the fastest route you can take so that you can complete all of your tasks in the shortest amount of time. Consigliere calculates the most optimal route by taking into consideration the time you will spend at each location, the nature of the task at that location (bank, post office) and the traffic level of the roads between each task area. In light of all the aforementioned data, a graph is constructed and on this graph, the Traveling Salesman Algorithm is executed to provide you with the most optimal way to visit all task points as quickly as possible.
